    "text": "1.1 Relationship Between Health and Place\nOne reason why it is difficult to prove a causal relationship between environmental risk factors such as air pollution and a health outcome is because health outcomes can be cumulative results of a combination of factors. When considering air pollution’s impact on health, one such factor are air pollution’s exposure pathways. Exposure can vary depending on distance from sources of pollution and the amount of time spent breathing in pollutants, both of which can fluctuate when considering climate, ventilation, time spent outdoors, among other factors. Arguably the simplest way to measure exposure is by measuring proximity to pollutant sources. However, spatial analysis of epidemiological phenomena should consider more than just geographic location. This is because an individual’s activity spaces are not simply a feature of that person, but a reflection of a myriad of influences that result in an individuals’ choice to frequent those spaces. Entwisle highlights this topic in Putting People into Place, arguing that there is a critical need to “incorporate agency in theories of neighborhood and health,” (Entwisle 2007, 699). Entwisle identifies the symbiotic relationship between individuals’ opportunities, social interactions, BLAH that inform decisions to move to or remain in a space, and how that informs health decisions. She also acknowledges that individuals can influence their communities. Bernard and colleagues build on this notion by formalizing a conceptualization of neighborhoods. Their framework identifies four primary influences on access to health-related resources: “proximity, rights, prices, and informal reciprocity,” (Bernard et al. 2007, 1849). WRAP ABOUT HOW THIS RELATES.\nThis research acknowledges the role that individual decisions play in informing their activity spaces by including demographic and quality of life variables. The inclusion of these variables help to contextualize individuals within each county. These variables range from race to income, education, access to care, and health behaviors. By including demographic and quality of life variables, the model attempts to characterize those occupying the spaces, account for factors that influence interactions with health related resources, and acknowledge the role of positive and negative health behaviors on mortality risk.\nThe fact that this research fails to acknowledge the role that individuals’ play in influencing their localities is a shortcoming that can be addressed in future iterations of this model. Local communities are constantly being reshaped in large and small ways. Agency over change in space (use the vocabulary that Browning uses) can be evaluated by reviewing changes in localities over time. In this research, individual influence over their communities may manifest in improvements to regulations to reduce industrial air pollution, improvement to ventilation systems, and increases in indoor recreation alternatives, to name a few examples. Such interventions could lower community exposure to air pollution and potentially reduce adverse health impacts. A future enhancement to this model would incorporate variables over a longer time horizon to measure sensitivity of mortality rates to changes in localities over time."

    "section": "1.2 Data and Methods",
    "text": "1.2 Data and Methods\nData fall into four major categories: health, demographic, air pollution, and land use. However, since this is a spatial analysis, the common thread in all data sources is the spatial linkage. Spatial evaluation of air pollution’s impact on health is considered on a regional level. Following the approach that Simon and colleagues take to evaluate ozone trends in the U.S., this analysis also uses NOAA climate regions in the analysis of air pollution (2015). Evaluation of data on a regional scale lowers the model’s sensitivity to factors such as wind, climate, and pollutants’ chemical reactions with other molecules in the air that can cause the concentration of air pollution to change (Simon et al. 2015, pp 186, pp. 188). To this end, four regions were selected for this research, which represent different climate areas and a wide variety of land cover types.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1; Annual summary of air quality metrics by monitoring site from 2014 - 2016\n\n\n\n\nThis research focuses on particulate matter (PM) 2.5 measures from 2015, as captured by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and further manipulated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). PM 2.5 are “fine, inhalable particles with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers or smaller,” that have been linked to various complications with lung and heart functions (US EPA 2016). The EPA publishes extensive amounts of air quality data, which are accessible through their Air Data website. Available data include annual summaries by monitor.\nFigure 1 plots the 2015 annual PM 2.5 measures on region-dependent scales by NOAA Climate region to provide a geographic reference for monitor locations and start to visually represent the variation in PM 2.5 measurements by region. The entire contiguous U.S. is represented in Figure 1, but it is worth noting that only the Northwest, West, Ohio Valley, and Southeast NOAA Climate Regions were selected for this study. These regions were selected due to their climatic variation, regional air quality variation, and either high presence or decent distribution of air quality monitors. A visual inspection of Figure 1 reveals how monitors are distributed throughout each region and their individual readings. It is noted that though the West region has a relative abundance of monitors in California, monitors are sparse in Nevada. This observation leads to the acknowledgement of potential spatial bias: monitors are not normally distributed throughout space, therefore spatial bias may be introduced due to the distribution of data across the measurement areas. However, the level of spatial bias difficult to measure due to the use of the CDC’s modeled data.\n\n\n\nThe CDC provides measured and modeled PM 2.5 data by county for the U.S., as depicted in Figure 2. They derive their data from daily PM 2.5 measurements produced by the EPA, then further model to infer measurements for areas where there are gaps in the data. Derivations are primarily based on the Downscaler (DS) model, which is “a statistical fusion of monitoring data and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) outputs,” [@geograph]. While use of this data is convenient, a future iteration of this research will produce and employ a PM 2.5 inference model, which would be produced specifically for this research. Doing so would control for any unknowns that are introduced due to the limitations of using modeled data that is not easily reproducible.\nOne limitation of the air quality data used in this model is the use of annually summarized data. While useful, annual summaries may not be sensitive enough to capture acute changes in air quality, which pose a health risk (CITE?). This relationship may not be captured in the model if poor air quality days are infrequent enough to impact the mean. For simplicity, this research does not take seasonality into consideration and instead uses annual averages, which does not accurately reflect variation in air pollution ranges.\nDESCRIBE FIGURE 2\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2; County-level air pollution statistics. Region selection limited by availability of data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\nRespiratory health is measured by age-adjusted mortality rates by county, accessed through the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) WONDER database. The first data set extracted is all-age, all-cause age-adjusted mortality rate by county for the three-year period from 2014 through 2016. Data were further filtered based on primary reported cause of death based on the ICD-10 code range I00-I99, which encompasses cardiovascular diseases and J00-J98, respiratory diseases (“CDC WONDER,” n.d.). Previous research exposing correlations between air pollution and mortality have focused on the same set of diagnostic codes (O’Neill et al. 2008), (Wong et al. 2008). One limitation of data on the primary cause of death is that health can be influenced by a variety of issues. When there are multiple causes of death, those multiple causes are noted but for this purpose, only the primary cause is used to characterize the cardiovascular or respiratory disease-related death population. Therefore, the data would be missing those who had respiratory illnesses as a contributing factor but not the primary cause. It would be interesting to better analyze this population to see if there are trends that would support the inclusion of respiratory disease as a cause of death (and not just the primary cause), but for this research, honing in on the primary cause of death should be sufficient. Another limitation is that the diagnostic classes used in this model are broad. It is an intentional choice to cast a wide net on mortality causes because air pollution’s impact on individual health can manifest in a variety of ways. However, the shortcoming of this tactic is that it introduces more data that may potentially be unrelated to air pollution. This is something to be mindful of when reviewing the results of data modeling.\nDESCRIBE DATA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\nTo further characterize county populations, demographic and behavioral data are consulted. 2015 data on age-adjusted adult smoking rates by county are extracted from the University of Wisconsin Public Health Institute’s County Health Rankings. This data are consulted to normalize out any distortions caused by smoking habits by county. However, prevalence rates do not capture the severity of tobacco use by individual. Severity of smoking habits are not considered in this model. County Health Rankings’ source for its smoking data is the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) (“Adult Smoking,” n.d.). County Health Rankings data aggregates other useful variables that are used in their model. Adult obesity rates by county, sourced from BRFSS data, are also used. One limitation to the BRFSS is that data is collected from surveys, then extrapolated to characterize county-level summaries. The conduction of surveys and extrapolation process leave room for error so is noted for transparency. Another data point extracted from County Health Rankings is the percent of the population that is uninsured (Source: U.S. Census Bureau’s Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE)) (“2022 Measures,” n.d.). SAHIE’s percent uninsured estimates the percent of the population that is 65 and under who do not have health insurance (“Uninsured,” n.d.). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, “SAHIE uses statistical models that combine survey data from the American Community Survey (ACS) with administrate records data and Census 2010 data,” (Bureau, n.d.). The benefit of SAHIE’s modeling approach is that it attempts to control for estimates for small areas where data is more sparse (Bureau, n.d.). As with any modeled data, a notable risk is the reliance on the robustness of the U.S. Census Bureau’s model, though the Census Bureau does provide margins of error for their model results. Other demographic data are obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates. 2016 data for following variables are used in this model: Percent poverty, percent Black, percent Hispanic, urbanization, and education statistics. ACS data are obtained through the Census API, accessed through R Studio.\nLand cover data used in this model are originally sourced from the National Land Cover Database’s (NLCD). The International Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) released county-level summaries of NLCD land cover data, which are displayed in the ensuing plots. Per IPUMS’ annotations on methodology, NLCD data were layered with census geographic polygons to calculate the area covered by each land class (“Environmental Summaries | IPUMS NHGIS,” n.d.). Land cover classifications are determined by NLCD using a modified Anderson Land Cover Classification System (“National Land Cover Database Class Legend and Description | Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium,” n.d.). A description of NLCD’s land cover classifications are denoted in the data table below. Data used in this model reflect 2011 land cover data summarized by county geographic boundaries in the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2015 data set.\n\n\n\nNLCD Land Cover Types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\nThis research uses regression modeling on three NOAA climate regions to test if creating models for each region produces significant results. The region-based modeling using NOAA’s climatically consistent region definitions draws from research on by Simon and colleagues. Simon and colleagues justify their use of NOAA climate regions by acknowledging that ozone patterns are partially determined by temperature and precipitation (2015, 188). Additionally, they note that climate regions generally group areas with similar emissions types and similar trends in temporal variation due to daylight and season (Simon et al. 2015, 188). By modeling for each region, I attempt to normalize out some of the variation due to climate, seasonality, and emissions type which should remove some noise from the models.\nCalculating the entropy index: Let Pj be the percentage each of land use type j in the county, and let n be the number of land use types j.\n\\[\nEntropy =\n-[\\sum_{j=1}^n p_j \\ln p_j]/ln(n)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nData are first approximated at a county level. Air quality data is captured by monitors, whose locations are indicated in the EPA’s data files. In order to spread air quality metrics over space, spatial interpolation is used (add specifications). Land cover data is also approximated at the county level by using R to quantify the area of major land cover types that are measured in each county.REMOVE?\nThe dependent variable that is being used as a proxy for health is age-adjusted mortality rate for respiratory diseases. After a review of the dependent and independent variables, OLS regression models are consulted. The OLS regression model will estimate the effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable. Different combinations of variables are tested to evaluate what creates the best model, and results are evaluated for statistical significance.\nA linear regression model is then evaluated for spatial autocorrelation. The regression model depends on independence and heteroskedasticity of residuals. If spatial autocorrelation is present, then both rules are broken. Spatial autocorrelation is tested using the Global Moran’s I test, followed by mapping the Local Moran’s I. Spatial clustering is revealed by the Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) map. The Lagrange Multiplier test is consulted to determine if spatial error or spatial lag is driving spatial autocorrelation in the model. Based on the Lagrange Multiplier results, the spatial [lag/error] model is used to try to produce a better model.\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = AAMR_all_ICDI_use ~ pct_white + pct_black + pct_hispanic + \n    pct_bach + pct_pov + PM2.5 + pct_smokers + pct_obese + pct_uninsured + \n    entropy + HDD + PCP, data = c_df6_a)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-2.5382 -0.4207 -0.0241  0.3785  3.6923 \n\nCoefficients:\n                Estimate Std.
