    "text": "1.1 Data and Methods\nData fall into four major categories: health, demographic, air pollution, and land use. However, since this is a spatial analysis, the common thread in all data sources is the spatial linkage. Spatial evaluation of air pollution’s impact on health is considered on a regional level. Following the approach that Simon and colleagues take to evaluate ozone trends in the U.S., this analysis also uses NOAA climate regions in the analysis of air pollution (2015). Evaluation of data on a regional scale lowers the model’s sensitivity to factors such as wind, climate, and pollutants’ chemical reactions with other molecules in the air that can cause the concentration of air pollution to change (Simon et al. 2015, pp 186, pp. 188). To this end, five regions were selected for this research, which represent different climate areas and a wide variety of land cover types.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1; Annual summary of air quality metrics by monitoring site from 2014 - 2016\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 plots the 2015 annual PM 2.5 measures on different scales by region to better evaluate the measurement trends. The west region has the highest annual PM 2.5 readings in two monitors in particular. KEEP EXPLAINING.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2; Average Annual PM 2.5 by region. Regional P.M 2.5 levels plotted on different scales.\n\n\n\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publishes extensive amounts of air quality data through their Air Data site. This research focuses on PM 2.5 and Ozone data. PM 2.5 is a measure of the ambient air pollution… EXPLAIN MORE. EPA’s annual summaries of air quality metrics by monitoring site for the years 2014 through 2016 are used in this model. Location data on monitoring sites are included in the data set. Spatial interpolation techniques are used to infer air pollution estimates for unobserved locations (see: Introduction to spatial data analysis | Data Science (stanford.edu)). MORE ABOUT THIS AND WRAP.\nRespiratory health is measured by age-adjusted mortality rates by county, accessed through the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) WONDER database. The first data set extracted is all-age, all-cause age-adjusted mortality rate by county for the three-year period from 2014 through 2016. Data were further filtered based on primary reported cause of death based on the ICD-10 code range J00-J99, which encompasses respiratory disease (NOTATE data integrity as a limitation later). Finally, a third data set limited the respiratory disease age-adjusted mortality rates to the 65 and over population. [ADD GRAPHS for age-adjusted mortality rates and explain.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALSO WHERE CAN I GET TOBACCO USE DATA?\nDemographic data are obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS extrapolates based on TALK ABOUT HOW ACS RESULTS ARE GENERATED. 5-year rates for the survey ended in 2016 are used in this model. CURRENTLY TARGETING THESE VARIABLES: Percent poverty, percent Black, percent Hispanic… what else? ACS data are obtained through the Census API, accessed through R Studio.\nLand cover data used in this model are from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). Data were downloaded from the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium website and further manipulated in R to differentiate primary land cover characteristics by county and by National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-defined climate regions.\nNEED TO SUMMARIZE BELOW… less explanatory?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dependent variable that is being used as a proxy for health is age-adjusted mortality rate for respiratory diseases. After a review of the dependent and independent variables, OLS regression models are consulted. The OLS regression model will estimate the effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable.\nDifferent combinations of variables are tested to evaluate what creates the best model, and results are evaluated for statistical significance. The first model evaluated includes the percent of urban households within a county to distinguish differences in county makeup.\nA linear regression model is then evaluated for spatial autocorrelation. The regression model depends on independence and heteroskedasticity of residuals. If spatial autocorrelation is present, then both rules are broken. Spatial autocorrelation is tested using the Global Moran’s I test, followed by mapping the Local Moran’s I. Spatial clustering is revealed by the Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) map. The Lagrange Multiplier test is consulted to determine if spatial error or spatial lag is driving spatial autocorrelation in the model. Based on the Lagrange Multiplier results, the spatial lag model is used to try to produce a better model.
