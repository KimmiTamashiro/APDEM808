    "text": "1.1 Relationship Between Health and Place\nOne reason why it is difficult to prove a causal relationship between environmental risk factors such as air pollution and a health outcome is because health outcomes can be cumulative results of a combination of factors. When considering air pollution’s impact on health, one such factor are air pollution’s exposure pathways. Exposure can vary depending on distance from sources of pollution and the amount of time spent breathing in pollutants, both of which can fluctuate when considering climate, ventilation, time spent outdoors, among other factors. Arguably the simplest way to measure exposure is by measuring proximity to pollutant sources. However, spatial analysis of epidemiological phenomena should consider more than just geographic location. This is because an individual’s activity spaces are not simply a feature of that person, but a reflection of a myriad of influences that result in an individuals’ choice to frequent those spaces. Entwisle highlights this topic in Putting People into Place, arguing that there is a critical need to “incorporate agency in theories of neighborhood and health,” (Entwisle 2007, 699). Entwisle identifies the symbiotic relationship between individuals’ opportunities, social interactions, BLAH that inform decisions to move to or remain in a space, and how that informs health decisions. She also acknowledges that individuals can influence their communities. Bernard and colleagues build on this notion by formalizing a conceptualization of neighborhoods. Their framework identifies four primary influences on access to health-related resources: “proximity, rights, prices, and informal reciprocity,” (Bernard et al. 2007, 1849). WRAP ABOUT HOW THIS RELATES.\nThis research acknowledges the role that individual decisions play in informing their activity spaces by including demographic and quality of life variables. The inclusion of these variables help to contextualize individuals within each county. These variables range from race to income, education, access to care, and health behaviors. By including demographic and quality of life variables, the model attempts to characterize those occupying the spaces, account for factors that influence interactions with health related resources, and acknowledge the role of positive and negative health behaviors on mortality risk.\nThe fact that this research fails to acknowledge the role that individuals’ play in influencing their localities is a shortcoming that can be addressed in future iterations of this model. Local communities are constantly being reshaped in large and small ways. Agency over change in space (use the vocabulary that Browning uses) can be evaluated by reviewing changes in localities over time. In this research, individual influence over their communities may manifest in improvements to regulations to reduce industrial air pollution, improvement to ventilation systems, and increases in indoor recreation alternatives, to name a few examples. Such interventions could lower community exposure to air pollution and potentially reduce adverse health impacts. A future enhancement to this model would incorporate variables over a longer time horizon to measure sensitivity of mortality rates to changes in localities over time."

    "section": "1.2 Data and Methods",
    "text": "1.2 Data and Methods\nData fall into four major categories: health, demographic, air pollution, and land use. However, since this is a spatial analysis, the common thread in all data sources is the spatial linkage. Spatial evaluation of air pollution’s impact on health is considered on a regional level. Following the approach that Simon and colleagues take to evaluate ozone trends in the U.S., this analysis also uses NOAA climate regions to summarize the analysis air pollution (2015). Evaluation of data on a regional scale is conceptually supported due to the NOAA climate region categorization of areas with similar wind, climate, and emissions sources, which all can influence the concentration of air pollution (Simon et al. 2015, pp 186, pp. 188). Additionally, in an acknowledgement of the environmental factors that influence both air pollution and health impacts, the model includes select annual, county-level climate variables.\nThis research focuses on particulate matter (PM) 2.5 measures from 2015, as captured by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and further manipulated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). PM 2.5 are “fine, inhalable particles with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers or smaller,” that have been linked to various complications with lung and heart functions (US EPA 2016). The EPA publishes extensive amounts of air quality data, which are accessible through their Air Data website. Available data include annual summaries by monitor.\nFigure 1 plots the 2015 annual PM 2.5 measures across the contiguous U.S. to provide a geographic reference for monitor locations and start to visually represent the variation in PM 2.5 measurements by region. A visual inspection of Figure 1 reveals how monitors are distributed throughout each region and their individual readings. It is noted that monitors are highly concentrated in certain areas (for example, the New Jersey to Massachusetts area) and few and far between in others (for example, in the Western landlocked states). This observation leads to the acknowledgement of potential spatial bias: monitors are not normally distributed throughout space, therefore spatial bias may be introduced due to the distribution of data across the measurement areas. However, the level of spatial bias difficult to measure due to this model’s use of CDC-modeled data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1; Annual summary of air quality metrics by monitoring site from 2014 - 2016\n\n\n\n\nThe CDC provides measured and modeled PM 2.5 data by county for the U.S., as depicted in Figure 2. They derive their data from daily PM 2.5 measurements produced by the EPA, then further model to infer measurements for areas where there are gaps in the data. Derivations are primarily based on the Downscaler (DS) model, which is “a statistical fusion of monitoring data and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) outputs,” [@geograph]. While use of this data is convenient, a future iteration of this research will produce and employ a PM 2.5 inference model, which would be produced specifically for this research. Doing so would control for any unknowns that are introduced due to the limitations of using modeled data that is not easily reproducible.\nOne limitation of the air quality data used in this model is the use of annually summarized data. While useful, annual summaries may not be sensitive enough to capture acute changes in air quality, which pose a health risk (CITE?). This relationship may not be captured in the model if poor air quality days are infrequent enough to impact the mean. For simplicity, this research does not take seasonality into consideration and instead uses annual averages, which does not accurately reflect variation in air pollution ranges.\nTALK ABOUT HOW THIS YEAR COMPARES TO OTHER YEARS\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2; County-level air pollution statistics. Region selection limited by availability of data\n\n\n\n\nClimate data are included in this model to account for impacts of environmental factors on PM2.5 levels. Research by Zhang and colleagues comparing daily PM2.5 measurements against various daily climate indicators found a strong positive relationship between high temperatures with increased PM2.5 concentration, with the highest correlation found in rural areas. An overwhleming pattern of overlap between extreme high PM2.5 levels and extreme heat days was found in most weather monitors across the country (Zhang et al. 2017, 75). They also found that days with extremely low relative humidity were associated with a higher probability of extreme PM 2.5 concentration (Zhang et al. 2017, 77). This association is especially strong in the northern U.S. and Great Plains regions, which Zhang and colleagues attribute to relative humidity’s impact on particle formation due to power plant emissions and agricultural activities (Zhang et al. 2017, 75). Though Zhang and colleagues found strong, statistically significant relationships, they also note that complexities exist between PM2.5 concentration and climate factors. Bell and colleagues highlight this point succintly in their analysis of PM2.5 components, noting that “the PM2.5 mixture varies strongly by region and by season, and the degree of spatial and temporaly variability varies by component,” (“Spatial and Temporal Variation in PM2.5 Chemical Composition in the United States for Health Effects Studies,” n.d., 993). At any given time, variations in the mixture of PM2.5 components may magnify or subdue expected reactions with climatic events.\nClimate can also impact health independently of its impact on air pollution. Research on cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalizations in Cyprus, Greece found significant correlations between increased hospitalizations and two climactic categories: “cold, cloudy days with increased levels of precipitation,” and “warm, rainy days with increased levels of water vapor in the atmosphere,” (Tsangari et al. 2016, 251). Their findings suggest depressed health on days when the climate causes discomfort: days when temperatures and humidity are high, as well as on cold days with increased precipitation. WRAP UP SENTENCE TO DRIVE HOME WHY CLIMATE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR.\nFor ease of interpretation, climate data are summarized by NOAA climate region. Figure 3 is included as a reference to show which states are included in each region.\n\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 9 x 2\n  reg_names states                                        \n* <chr>     <chr>                                         \n1 NE        PA, VT, MA, NH, DE, CT, NJ, MD, ME, RI, NY, DC\n2 NR        NE, SD, WY, MT, ND                            \n3 NW        WA, OR, ID                                    \n4 OV        KY, TN, IN, IL, OH, MO, WV                    \n5 S         AR, MS, OK, LA, KS, TX                        \n6 SE        GA, SC, AL, NC, VA, FL                        \n7 SW        NM, CO, UT, AZ                                \n8 UM        IA, WI, MI, MN                                \n9 W         NV, CA                                        \n\n\nFigure 4 displays climate variables of interest based on county groupings into NOAA climate regions. The box-and-whisker plots show the distribution of county-level climate in 2015. The top three plots show temperature trends in 2015 across the contiguous U.S. As expected, the areas with high average, maximum, and minimum temperatures are the South (S), Southeast (SE), and West (W) regions. The region with large variations in temperature indicators by county is the Southwest (SW). Though average temperatures for the region are lower than the other regions mentioned, there are a number of outliers whose average, minimum, and maximum temperatures in 2015 are significantly higher than the rest of the group. Climate regions with low minimum temperatures are the Northern Rockies (NR) and Upper Midwest (UM), whose mean minimum temperature is in the low thirties. By contrast, the South has the highest mean minimum temperature among its counties, averaging at fifty degrees.\nThe bottom three plots display annual cooling degree days, heating degree days, and precipitation. Degree days are an indicator of the “demand for energy to heat or cool houses and businesses,” indexed against a mean daily temperature of 65 degrees Fahrenheit (“Climate Prediction Center - Monitoring & Data: Weekly & Monthly Degree Day Summaries Explanation,” n.d.). Degree days are population weighted to better estimate the impact of temperature on human energy consumption (“Climate Prediction Center - Monitoring & Data: Weekly & Monthly Degree Day Summaries Explanation,” n.d.). The annual cooling and heating degree days are consistent with annual temperature trends. The relatively small interquartile ranges of cooling degree days by region suggest that cooling degree days are generally less varied, though there is a notable increase in high outliers in southern regions when comparing against the average annual temperature plot. The higher prevalence of these outliers implies two potential causes: either there is a small number of counties that have consistently higher temperatures than other counties in their respective regions or that areas with higher temperatures have high population densities (impacting the population weighting component of the degree day calculation). The annual precipitation plot shows that there is little variation in most regions: all but the Northwest (NW), South (S), and West (W) regions have fairly tight ranges. The Northwest shows the regional largest variance within its counties in 2015, encompassing counties on the low end when comparing across the entire contiguous U.S. while also including counties the extreme high end.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\nTo determine which of these climate indicators may be significant in the model, the below figures explore the relationship between annual PM 2.5 concentration and the various climate indicators. Figure 5 plots the six climate variables against PM 2.5 concentration for all counties. While there certainly is variation in the data points for the six climate variables, the PM 2.5 concentration nationally is much more uniform, resulting in significant, but low positive correlations for each set of variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\nPlotting the data for the wide, national scope is not very meaningful. Instead, Figures 6 through 11 parses the data based on NOAA climate region to better evaluate nuances of the relationships between PM 2.5 concentration and climate variables. Notably, western regions (West, Northwest, and Southwest) have a smaller quantity of counties so they are grouped into one plot for the purposes of these visualizations.\nCooling degree days does not appear to be have a significant relationship with PM 2.5 concentration in 2015, though there is a significant, moderately positive relationship between the two variables in the Upper Midwest.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\nThe correlations between PM 2.5 concentration and maximum temperature are significant positive in the Upper Midwest (R=0.68) and Northeast (R=0.5). Interestingly, in Ohio Valley the relationship is significant and moderately negative (R=-0.41). This indicates that in the Ohio Valley region, counties with lower maximum temperatures in 2015 also tended to have higher annual PM 2.5 levels. A visual inspection of the Ohio Valley plot reveals that there is a relatively wide range of maximum temperatures in the Ohio Valley region but a small and dense range of PM 2.5 concentrations in this area.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\nHeating degree days and PM 2.5 concentrations show similar relationships in the Upper Midwest region (R=0.73) and Ohio Valley (R = -0.39). The two variables in both of these regions show a significant relationship, though in the Upper Midwest, that relationship is strongly positive, and in Ohio Valley, it is moderately negative. The other regions do not seem to have significant relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\nThe Upper Midwest region and the South both show significant, positive relationships between minimum temperature and PM 2.5 concentration.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\nPrecipitation levels appear to have a significant and fairly strong positive relationship with PM 2.5 concentration in the South (R=0.69) and Northern Rockies (R=0.57). WAS THIS ANTICIPATED?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\nRespiratory health is measured by age-adjusted mortality rates by county, accessed through the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) WONDER database. The first data set extracted is all-age, all-cause age-adjusted mortality rate by county for the three-year period from 2014 through 2016. Data were further filtered based on primary reported cause of death based on the ICD-10 code range I00-I99, which encompasses cardiovascular diseases and J00-J98, respiratory diseases (“CDC WONDER,” n.d.). Previous research exposing correlations between air pollution and mortality have focused on the same set of diagnostic codes (O’Neill et al. 2008), (Wong et al. 2008). One limitation of data on the primary cause of death is that health can be influenced by a variety of issues. When there are multiple causes of death, those multiple causes are noted but for this purpose, only the primary cause is used to characterize the cardiovascular or respiratory disease-related death population. Therefore, the data would be missing those who had respiratory illnesses as a contributing factor but not the primary cause. It would be interesting to better analyze this population to see if there are trends that would support the inclusion of respiratory disease as a cause of death (and not just the primary cause), but for this research, honing in on the primary cause of death should be sufficient. Another limitation is that the diagnostic classes used in this model are broad. It is an intentional choice to cast a wide net on mortality causes because air pollution’s impact on individual health can manifest in a variety of ways. However, the shortcoming of this tactic is that it introduces more data that may potentially be unrelated to air pollution. This is something to be mindful of when reviewing the results of data modeling.\nDESCRIBE DATA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe below figures plot age-adjusted mortality rates (Figure X: All ages and Figure Y: 65 and over population only) against 2015 maximum temperatures by county. There is a significant, positive relationship in the Ohio Valley area, indicating that counties with higher maximum temperatures tended to have higher age-adjusted mortality rates. This positive relationship is lower in the 65 and over population.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\nThe next two figures plot age-adjusted mortality rates (Figure X: All ages and Figure Y: 65 and over population only) against 2015 precipitaion levels by county. There is a significant, positive relationship in both the South and Ohio Valley areas, indicating that counties with higher precipitation levels tended to have higher age-adjusted mortality rates. As with the maximum temperature findings, there positive relationships are lower in the 65 and over population.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\nTo further characterize county populations, demographic and behavioral data are consulted. 2015 data on age-adjusted adult smoking rates by county are extracted from the University of Wisconsin Public Health Institute’s County Health Rankings. This data are consulted to normalize out any distortions caused by smoking habits by county. However, prevalence rates do not capture the severity of tobacco use by individual. Severity of smoking habits are not considered in this model. County Health Rankings’ source for its smoking data is the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) (“Adult Smoking,” n.d.). County Health Rankings data aggregates other useful variables that are used in their model. Adult obesity rates by county, sourced from BRFSS data, are also used. One limitation to the BRFSS is that data is collected from surveys, then extrapolated to characterize county-level summaries. The conduction of surveys and extrapolation process leave room for error so is noted for transparency. Another data point extracted from County Health Rankings is the percent of the population that is uninsured (Source: U.S. Census Bureau’s Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE)) (“2022 Measures,” n.d.). SAHIE’s percent uninsured estimates the percent of the population that is 65 and under who do not have health insurance (“Uninsured,” n.d.). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, “SAHIE uses statistical models that combine survey data from the American Community Survey (ACS) with administrate records data and Census 2010 data,” (Bureau, n.d.). The benefit of SAHIE’s modeling approach is that it attempts to control for estimates for small areas where data is more sparse (Bureau, n.d.). As with any modeled data, a notable risk is the reliance on the robustness of the U.S. Census Bureau’s model, though the Census Bureau does provide margins of error for their model results. Other demographic data are obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates. 2016 data for following variables are used in this model: Percent poverty, percent Black, percent Hispanic, urbanization, and education statistics. ACS data are obtained through the Census API, accessed through R Studio.\nLand cover data used in this model are originally sourced from the National Land Cover Database’s (NLCD). The International Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) released county-level summaries of NLCD land cover data, which are displayed in the ensuing plots. Per IPUMS’ annotations on methodology, NLCD data were layered with census geographic polygons to calculate the area covered by each land class (“Environmental Summaries | IPUMS NHGIS,” n.d.). Land cover classifications are determined by NLCD using a modified Anderson Land Cover Classification System (“National Land Cover Database Class Legend and Description | Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium,” n.d.). A description of NLCD’s land cover classifications are denoted in the data table below. Data used in this model reflect 2011 land cover data summarized by county geographic boundaries in the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2015 data set.\n\n\n\nNLCD Land Cover Types\n\n\nLand cover data are summarized into the following major classes: wetlands (woody and emergent herbaceous), planted (pasture, cultivated crops), herbaceous (grassland / herbaceous), shrubland (shrub/scrub), forest (deciduous, evergreen, and mixed forest), barren (barren land - rocks and clay), developed (low, mid, and high intensity development), and water (open water, perennial ice/snow). National county-level distribution of proportional land cover are displayed in FIGURE WHAT below. The planted (pasture, cultivated crops) and forest land cover types have even and long distributions, indicating that proportions of land dedicated to these land cover types vary widely by county and are not normally distributed. Other land cover types are closer to normal distributions. Notably, the first quartile of wetlands, herbaceous, shrubland, barren, and water are around 0%, indicating that around one quarter of counties in the contiguous U.S. are not at all represented by at least one of those land cover types.\nLONG TAILS\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12; UPDATE CAPTION\n\n\n\n\nThis research uses regression modeling on three NOAA climate regions to test if creating models for each region produces significant results. The region-based modeling using NOAA’s climatically consistent region definitions draws from research on by Simon and colleagues. Simon and colleagues justify their use of NOAA climate regions by acknowledging that ozone patterns are partially determined by temperature and precipitation (2015, 188). Additionally, they note that climate regions generally group areas with similar emissions types and similar trends in temporal variation due to daylight and season (Simon et al. 2015, 188). By modeling for each region, I attempt to normalize out some of the variation due to climate, seasonality, and emissions type which should remove some noise from the models.\nCalculating the entropy index: Let Pj be the percentage each of land use type j in the county, and let n be the number of land use types j.\n\\[\nEntropy =\n-[\\sum_{j=1}^n p_j \\ln p_j]/ln(n)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData are first approximated at a county level. Air quality data is captured by monitors, whose locations are indicated in the EPA’s data files. In order to spread air quality metrics over space, spatial interpolation is used (add specifications). Land cover data is also approximated at the county level by using R to quantify the area of major land cover types that are measured in each county.REMOVE?\nThe dependent variable that is being used as a proxy for health is age-adjusted mortality rate for respiratory diseases. After a review of the dependent and independent variables, OLS regression models are consulted. The OLS regression model will estimate the effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable. Different combinations of variables are tested to evaluate what creates the best model, and results are evaluated for statistical significance.\nA linear regression model is then evaluated for spatial autocorrelation. The regression model depends on independence and heteroskedasticity of residuals. If spatial autocorrelation is present, then both rules are broken. Spatial autocorrelation is tested using the Global Moran’s I test, followed by mapping the Local Moran’s I. Spatial clustering is revealed by the Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) map. The Lagrange Multiplier test is consulted to determine if spatial error or spatial lag is driving spatial autocorrelation in the model. Based on the Lagrange Multiplier results, the spatial [lag/error] model is used to try to produce a better model."
