    "text": "1.1 Data and Methods\nData fall into four major categories: health, demographic, air pollution, and land use. However, since this is a spatial analysis, the common thread in all data sources is the spatial linkage. Spatial evaluation of air pollution’s impact on health is considered on a regional level. Following the approach that Simon and colleagues take to evaluate ozone trends in the U.S., this analysis also uses NOAA climate regions in the analysis of air pollution (2015). Evaluation of data on a regional scale lowers the model’s sensitivity to factors such as wind, climate, and pollutants’ chemical reactions with other molecules in the air that can cause the concentration of air pollution to change (Simon et al. 2015, pp 186, pp. 188). To this end, five regions were selected for this research, which represent different climate areas and a wide variety of land cover types.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1; Annual summary of air quality metrics by monitoring site from 2014 - 2016\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 plots the 2015 annual PM 2.5 measures on different scales by region to better evaluate the measurement trends.

Region selection limited by availability of data\n\n\n\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publishes extensive amounts of air quality data through their Air Data site. This research focuses on PM 2.5 and Ozone data. PM 2.5 is a measure of the ambient air pollution… EXPLAIN MORE. EPA’s annual summaries of air quality metrics by monitoring site for the years 2014 through 2016 are used in this model. Location data on monitoring sites are included in the data set. Spatial interpolation techniques are used to infer air pollution estimates for unobserved locations (see: Introduction to spatial data analysis | Data Science (stanford.edu)). MORE ABOUT THIS AND WRAP.\nRespiratory health is measured by age-adjusted mortality rates by county, accessed through the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) WONDER database. The first data set extracted is all-age, all-cause age-adjusted mortality rate by county for the three-year period from 2014 through 2016. Data were further filtered based on primary reported cause of death based on the ICD-10 code range J00-J99, which encompasses respiratory diseases (NOTATE data integrity as a limitation later). Finally, a third data set limited the respiratory disease age-adjusted mortality rates to the 65 and over population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALSO WHERE CAN I GET TOBACCO USE DATA?\nDemographic data are obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS extrapolates based on TALK ABOUT HOW ACS RESULTS ARE GENERATED. 5-year rates for the survey ended in 2016 are used in this model. CURRENTLY TARGETING THESE VARIABLES: Percent poverty, percent Black, percent Hispanic… what else? ACS data are obtained through the Census API, accessed through R Studio.\nLand cover data used in this model are from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). Data were downloaded from the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium website and further manipulated in R to differentiate primary land cover characteristics by county and by National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-defined climate regions.\nNEED TO SUMMARIZE BELOW… less explanatory?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dependent variable that is being used as a proxy for health is age-adjusted mortality rate for respiratory diseases. After a review of the dependent and independent variables, OLS regression models are consulted. The OLS regression model will estimate the effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable.\nDifferent combinations of variables are tested to evaluate what creates the best model, and results are evaluated for statistical significance. The first model evaluated includes the percent of urban households within a county to distinguish differences in county makeup.\nA linear regression model is then evaluated for spatial autocorrelation. The regression model depends on independence and heteroskedasticity of residuals. If spatial autocorrelation is present, then both rules are broken. Spatial autocorrelation is tested using the Global Moran’s I test, followed by mapping the Local Moran’s I. Spatial clustering is revealed by the Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) map. The Lagrange Multiplier test is consulted to determine if spatial error or spatial lag is driving spatial autocorrelation in the model. Based on the Lagrange Multiplier results, the spatial lag model is used to try to produce a better model.

    "text": "Data Summary\nThis section is to satisfy L04 Assignment: Summary of Data Use\n\nData fall into four major categories: health, demographic, air pollution, and land use. However, since this is a spatial analysis, the common thread in all data sources is the spatial linkage. Spatial evaluation of air pollution’s impact on health is considered on a regional level. Following the approach that Simon and colleagues take to evaluate ozone trends in the U.S., this analysis also uses NOAA climate regions in the analysis of air pollution (2015). Evaluation of data on a regional scale lowers the model’s sensitivity to factors such as wind, climate, and pollutants’ chemical reactions with other molecules in the air that can cause the concentration of air pollution to change (Simon et al. 2015, pp 186, pp. 188). To this end, five regions were selected for this research, which represent different climate areas and a wide variety of land cover types.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publishes extensive amounts of air quality data through their Air Data site. This research focuses on PM 2.5 and Ozone data. PM 2.5 is a measure of the ambient air pollution… EXPLAIN MORE. EPA’s annual summaries of air quality metrics by monitoring site for the years 2014 through 2016 are used in this model. Location data on monitoring sites are included in the data set. Spatial interpolation techniques are used to infer air pollution estimates for unobserved locations (see: Introduction to spatial data analysis | Data Science (stanford.edu)). MORE ABOUT THIS AND WRAP. One limitation to this technique is that annual summaries, while useful, may not be sensitive enough to capture acute changes in air quality, which pose a health risk (CITE?). This relationship may not be captured in the model if poor air quality days are infrequent enough to impact the mean. Additionally, some monitors capture and report air quality more frequently than others, so there could be some variation due to the frequency of measurement capture. For simplicity, this research does not take seasonality into consideration and instead uses annual averages, which does not accurately reflect variation in air pollution ranges. Finally, the biggest limitation as it relates to our spatial model is that monitors are not normally distributed throughout space. Spatial bias is introduced due to the distribution of data across the measurement areas.\nRespiratory health is measured by age-adjusted mortality rates by county, accessed through the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) WONDER database. The first data set extracted is all-age, all-cause age-adjusted mortality rate by county for the three-year period from 2014 through 2016. Data were further filtered based on primary reported cause of death based on the ICD-10 code range J00-J99, which encompasses respiratory disease. Finally, a third data set limited the respiratory disease age-adjusted mortality rates to the 65 and over population. One limitation of data on the primary cause of death is that health can be influenced by a variety of issues. When there are multiple causes of death, those multiple causes are noted but for this purpose, only the primary cause is used to characterize the respiratory disease-related death population. Therefore, the data would be missing those who had respiratory illnesses as a contributing factor but not the primary cause. It would be interesting to better analyze this population to see if there are trends that would support the inclusion of respiratory disease as a cause of death (and not just the primary cause), but for this research, honing in on the primary cause of death should be sufficient.\nTo further characterize county populations, demographic and behavioral data are consulted. Data on age-adjusted adult smoking rates by county are extracted from the University of Wisconsin Public Health Institute’s County Health Rankings. This data is consulted to normalize out any distortions caused by smoking habits by county. However, prevalence rates do not capture the severity of tobacco use by individual. Severity of smoking habits are not considered in this model. County Health Rankings source for its smoking data is the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) (CITE Adult Smoking | County Health Rankings & Roadmaps). One limitation to the BRFSS is that data is collected fro surveys then extrapolated to characterize county-level summaries. The conduction of surveys and extrapolation process leave room for error so is noted for transparency. Demographic data are obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS). 5-year rates for the survey ended in 2016 are used in this model. CURRENTLY TARGETING THESE VARIABLES: Percent poverty, percent Black, percent Hispanic, urbanization are used in this model. ACS data are obtained through the Census API, accessed through R Studio.\nLand cover data used in this model are from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). Data were obtained from the FedData R package and further manipulated in R to differentiate primary land cover characteristics by county and by National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-defined climate regions. HOW ARE DATA CAPTURED?\nUsing a spatial approach to find an association to a health outcome introduces assumptions about populations’ exposure to pollutants. Since we are using county level data to characterize the populations, one assumption is that individuals’ activity spaces are primarily in their county of residence. This assumption is fallible, particularly for those living on the fringes of boundaries. Exposure to air pollution differs for those who spend more time outdoors than those who spend significant time indoors. HOW DO I ACCOUNT FOR THIS IN THE MODEL?\n\n\nMethods\nThis research uses regression modeling on three NOAA climate regions to test if creating models for each region produces significant results. The region-based modeling using NOAA’s climatically consistent region definitions draws from research on by Simon and colleagues. Simon and colleagues justify their use of NOAA climate regions by acknowledging that ozone patterns are partially determined by temperature and precipitation (2015, 188). Additionally, they note that climate regions generally group areas with similar emissions types and similar trends in temporal variation due to daylight and season (Simon et al. 2015, 188). By modeling for each region, I attempt to normalize out some of the variation due to climate, seasonality, and emissions type which should remove some noise from the models.\nData are first approximated at a county level. Air quality data is captured by monitors, whose locations are indicated in the EPA’s data files. In order to spread air quality metrics over space, spatial interpolation is used (add specifications). Land cover data is also approximated at the county level by using R to quantify the area of major land cover types that are measured in each county.\nThe dependent variable that is being used as a proxy for health is age-adjusted mortality rate for respiratory diseases. After a review of the dependent and independent variables, OLS regression models are consulted. The OLS regression model will estimate the effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable. Different combinations of variables are tested to evaluate what creates the best model, and results are evaluated for statistical significance.\nA linear regression model is then evaluated for spatial autocorrelation. The regression model depends on independence and heteroskedasticity of residuals. If spatial autocorrelation is present, then both rules are broken. Spatial autocorrelation is tested using the Global Moran’s I test, followed by mapping the Local Moran’s I. Spatial clustering is revealed by the Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) map. The Lagrange Multiplier test is consulted to determine if spatial error or spatial lag is driving spatial autocorrelation in the model. Based on the Lagrange Multiplier results, the spatial [lag/error] model is used to try to produce a better model.\n\n\n\n\nSimon, Heather, Adam Reff, Benjamin Wells, Jia Xing, and Neil Frank. 2015. “Ozone Trends Across the United States over a Period of Decreasing NOx and VOC Emissions.” Environmental Science & Technology 49 (1): 186–95. https://doi.org/10.1021/es504514z."
