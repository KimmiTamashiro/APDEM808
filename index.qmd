Data fall into four major categories: health, demographic, air pollution, and land use. However, since this is a spatial analysis, the common thread in all data sources is the spatial linkage. Spatial evaluation of air pollution's impact on health is considered on a regional level. Following the approach that Simon and colleagues take to evaluate ozone trends in the U.S., this analysis also uses NOAA climate regions in the analysis of air pollution [-@simon2015]. Evaluation of data on a regional scale lowers the model's sensitivity to factors such as wind, climate, and pollutants' chemical reactions with other molecules in the air that can cause the concentration of air pollution to change [@simon2015, pp 186, pp. 188]. To this end, five regions were selected for this research, which represent different climate areas and a wide variety of land cover types.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publishes extensive amounts of air quality data through their Air Data site. This research focuses on PM 2.5 and Ozone data. PM 2.5 is a measure of the ambient air pollution... EXPLAIN MORE. EPA's annual summaries of air quality metrics by monitoring site for the years 2014 through 2016 are used in this model. Location data on monitoring sites are included in the data set. Spatial interpolation techniques are used to infer air pollution estimates for unobserved locations (see: [Introduction to spatial data analysis \| Data Science (stanford.edu)](https://datascience.stanford.edu/news/introduction-spatial-data-analysis)). MORE ABOUT THIS AND WRAP. One limitation to this technique is that annual summaries, while useful, may not be sensitive enough to capture acute changes in air quality, which pose a health risk (CITE?). This relationship may not be captured in the model if poor air quality days are infrequent enough to impact the mean. Additionally, some monitors capture and report air quality more frequently than others, so there could be some variation due to the frequency of measurement capture. Finally, the biggest limitation as it relates to our spatial model is that monitors are not normally distributed throughout space. Spatial bias is introduced due to the distribution of data across the measurement areas.

Respiratory health is measured by age-adjusted mortality rates by county, accessed through the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) WONDER database. The first data set extracted is all-age, all-cause age-adjusted mortality rate by county for the three-year period from 2014 through 2016. Data were further filtered based on primary reported cause of death based on the ICD-10 code range J00-J99, which encompasses respiratory disease. Finally, a third data set limited the respiratory disease age-adjusted mortality rates to the 65 and over population. One limitation of data on the primary cause of death is that health can be influenced by a variety of issues. When there are multiple causes of death, those multiple causes are noted but for this purpose, only the primary cause is used to characterize the respiratory disease-related death population. Therefore, the data would be missing those who had respiratory illnesses as a contributing factor but not the primary cause. It would be interesting to better analyze this population to see if there are trends that would support the inclusion of respiratory disease as a cause of death (and not just the primary cause), but for this research, honing in on the primary cause of death should be sufficient.

To further characterize county populations, demographic and behavioral data are consulted. Survey data from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is used to understand smoking use by county. One limitation to the BRFSS is that data is collected fro surveys then extrapolated to characterize county-level summararies. The conduction of surveys and extrapolation process leave room for error so is noted for transparency. Demographic data are obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS extrapolates based on TALK ABOUT HOW ACS RESULTS ARE GENERATED. 5-year rates for the survey ended in 2016 are used in this model. CURRENTLY TARGETING THESE VARIABLES: Percent poverty, percent Black, percent Hispanic... what else? ACS data are obtained through the Census API, accessed through R Studio.

Land cover data used in this model are from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). Data were downloaded from the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium website and further manipulated in R to differentiate primary land cover characteristics by county and by National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-defined climate regions. HOW ARE DATA CAPTURED?

Using a spatial approach to find an association to a health outcome introduces two exposure assumptions: exposure spaces and exposure time. Since we are using county level data to characterize the populations, one assumption is that individuals' activity spaces are primarily in their county of residence. MORE ABOUT THIS. Another assumption, which may be of particular interest to this study, deals with exposure over time. Ambient air pollution may take time to ... Indoor versus outdoor.
